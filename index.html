    <h3 class="margin">What is Gamebridge?</h3>
    <p> Gamebridge is a panmedial library shelf that pairs classic children’s books with modern videogames. The idea is to ‘bridge’ the perceived gap between traditional texts and new media, providing parents, educators, and players with new ways of thinking about storytelling heritage and evolution. When we stop imagining videogames as the ‘opposite’ of classic literature and start positioning them alongside canonical children’s books, we can begin to really explore the merits and the shortcomings of texts offered to young people.
